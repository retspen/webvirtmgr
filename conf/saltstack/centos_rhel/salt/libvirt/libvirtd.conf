# Authentication.
#
#  - none: do not perform auth checks. If you can connect to the
#          socket you are allowed. This is suitable if there are
#          restrictions on connecting to the socket (eg, UNIX
#          socket permissions), or if there is a lower layer in
#          the network providing auth (eg, TLS/x509 certificates)
#
#  - sasl: use SASL infrastructure. The actual auth scheme is then
#          controlled from /etc/sasl2/libvirt.conf. For the TCP
#          socket only GSSAPI & DIGEST-MD5 mechanisms will be used.
#          For non-TCP or TLS sockets,  any scheme is allowed.
#
#  - polkit: use PolicyKit to authenticate. This is only suitable
#            for use on the UNIX sockets. The default policy will
#            require a user to supply their own password to gain
#            full read/write access (aka sudo like), while anyone
#            is allowed read/only access.
#
# Set an authentication scheme for UNIX read-only sockets
# By default socket permissions allow anyone to connect
#
# To restrict monitoring of domains you may wish to enable
# an authentication mechanism here
#auth_unix_ro = "none"

# Set an authentication scheme for UNIX read-write sockets
# By default socket permissions only allow root. If PolicyKit
# support was compiled into libvirt, the default will be to
# use 'polkit' auth.
#
# If the unix_sock_rw_perms are changed you may wish to enable
# an authentication mechanism here
#auth_unix_rw = "none"

# Change the authentication scheme for TCP sockets.
#
# If you don't enable SASL, then all TCP traffic is cleartext.

# mechanism in /etc/sasl2/libvirt.conf

#max_clients = 20


# The minimum limit sets the number of workers to start up

#
# XXX this isn't actually enforced yet, only the per-client
# limit is used so far

# Logging controls
#

# Logging level: 4 errors, 3 warnings, 2 information, 1 debug
# basically 1 will log everything possible
#log_level = 3

# Logging filters:
# A filter allows to select a different logging level for a given category
# of logs
# The format for a filter is one of:
#    x:name
#    x:+name
#      where name is a string which is matched against source file name,
#      e.g., "remote", "qemu", or "util/json", the optional "+" prefix
#      tells libvirt to log stack trace for each message matching name,
#      and x is the minimal level where matching messages should be logged:
#    1: DEBUG
#    2: INFO
#    3: WARNING
#    4: ERROR
#
# Multiple filter can be defined in a single @filters, they just need to be
# separated by spaces.
#
# e.g. to only get warning or errors from the remote layer and only errors
# from the event layer:
#log_filters="3:remote 4:event"

# Logging outputs:
# An output is one of the places to save logging information
# The format for an output can be:
#    x:stderr
#      output goes to stderr
#    x:syslog:name
#      use syslog for the output and use the given name as the ident
#    x:file:file_path
#      output to a file, with the given filepath
# In all case the x prefix is the minimal level, acting as a filter
#    1: DEBUG
#    2: INFO
#    3: WARNING
#    4: ERROR
#
# Multiple output can be defined, they just need to be separated by spaces.
# e.g. to log all warnings and errors to syslog under the libvirtd ident:
#log_outputs="3:syslog:libvirtd"
#

# Log debug buffer size: default 64
# The daemon keeps an internal debug log buffer which will be dumped in case
# of crash or upon receiving a SIGUSR2 signal. This setting allows to override
# the default buffer size in kilobytes.
# If value is 0 or less the debug log buffer is deactivated
#log_buffer_size = 64

# Auditing
#
# This setting allows usage of the auditing subsystem to be altered:
#
#   audit_level == 0  -> disable all auditing
#   audit_level == 1  -> enable auditing, only if enabled on host (default)
#   audit_level == 2  -> enable auditing, and exit if disabled on host
#
#audit_level = 2

# If set to 1, then audit messages will also be sent
# via libvirt logging infrastructure. Defaults to 0

# UUID of the host:
# Provide the UUID of the host here in case the command
# 'dmidecode -s system-uuid' does not provide a valid uuid. In case
# 'dmidecode' does not provide a valid UUID and none is provided here, a
# temporary UUID will be generated.
# Keep the format of the example UUID below. UUID must not have all digits
# be the same.

# NB This default all-zeros UUID will not work. Replace
# it with the output of the 'uuidgen' command and then
# uncomment this entry

###################################################################
# Keepalive protocol:
# This allows libvirtd to detect broken client connections or even
# dead client.  A keepalive message is sent to a client after
# keepalive_interval seconds of inactivity to check if the client is
# still responding; keepalive_count is a maximum number of keepalive
# messages that are allowed to be sent to the client without getting
# any response before the connection is considered broken.  In other
# words, the connection is automatically closed approximately after
# keepalive_interval * (keepalive_count + 1) seconds since the last
# message received from the client.  If keepalive_interval is set to
# -1, libvirtd will never send keepalive requests; however clients
# can still send them and the deamon will send responses.  When
# keepalive_count is set to 0, connections will be automatically
# closed after keepalive_interval seconds of inactivity without
# sending any keepalive messages.
#
#keepalive_interval = 5
#keepalive_count = 5
#
# If set to 1, libvirtd will refuse to talk to clients that do not
# support keepalive protocol.  Defaults to 0.

#keepalive_required = 1
