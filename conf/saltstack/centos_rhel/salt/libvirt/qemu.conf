# The default format for Qemu/KVM guest save images is raw; that is, the
# memory from the domain is dumped out directly to a file.  If you have
# guests with a large amount of memory, however, this can take up quite
# a bit of space.  If you would like to compress the images while they
# are being saved to disk, you can also set "lzop", "gzip", "bzip2", or "xz"
# for save_image_format.  Note that this means you slow down the process of
# saving a domain in order to save disk space; the list above is in descending
# order by performance and ascending order by compression ratio.
#
# save_image_format is used when you use 'virsh save' at scheduled
# saving, and it is an error if the specified save_image_format is
# not valid, or the requested compression program can't be found.
#
# dump_image_format is used when you use 'virsh dump' at emergency

# Keepalive protocol:
# This allows qemu driver to detect broken connections to remote
# libvirtd during peer-to-peer migration.  A keepalive message is
# sent to the deamon after keepalive_interval seconds of inactivity
# to check if the deamon is still responding; keepalive_count is a
# maximum number of keepalive messages that are allowed to be sent
# to the deamon without getting any response before the connection
# is considered broken.  In other words, the connection is
# automatically closed approximately after
# keepalive_interval * (keepalive_count + 1) seconds since the last
# message received from the deamon.  If keepalive_interval is set to
# -1, qemu driver will not send keepalive requests during
# peer-to-peer migration; however, the remote libvirtd can still
# send them and source libvirtd will send responses.  When
# keepalive_count is set to 0, connections will be automatically
